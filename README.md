# Little-Lemon-API

The Little Lemon API is an API for the Little Lemon restaurant. Little Lemon's management wants to have an online-based order management system and mobile application. The LittleLemonAPI is the back-end API that allows customers to browse food items, view the item of the day and place orders. Managers are able to update the item of the day and monitor orders and assign deliveries. The delivery crew are able to check the orders assigned to them and update an order once it is delivered.
